# Coding Standards and Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the [Project Name] to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## 1. General Guidelines

- **Readability:** Code should be clear, concise, and easy to read. Avoid overly complex logic and ensure consistent structure.
- **Consistency:** Follow the coding style consistently throughout the project.
- **Version Control:** Commit regularly and ensure meaningful commit messages (e.g., `Added validation to login form`).
- **Comments:** Use comments to explain complex code, but avoid over-commenting. Code should generally be self-explanatory.
- **DRY Principle:** Follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle by avoiding redundant code.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- **Variables and Functions:**
  - Use `camelCase` for variables and functions (e.g., `userData`, `fetchData()`).
  - Use descriptive names that clearly explain the purpose (e.g., `calculateTotalPrice`).
- **Classes:**
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ProductList`).
- **Constants:**
  - Use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_LIMIT`).
  
## 3. File Structure

- **File Names:** Use descriptive and consistent names for files. Use `PascalCase` for class files (e.g., `UserService.js`) and `kebab-case` for non-class files (e.g., `user-service.js`).
- **Organize by Feature:** Group related files and code into specific folders (e.g., `/components`, `/models`, `/services`).

## 4. Code Formatting

- **Indentation:** Use 2 or 4 spaces per indentation level (configurable based on project/team preference).
- **Line Length:** Keep lines to a maximum of 80-100 characters for readability.
- **Braces:** Use braces `{}` for all control structures (if, for, while), even for single-line blocks.
  ```js
  // Good
  if (condition) {
    doSomething();
  }

  // Bad
  if (condition) doSomething();
  ```
- **Whitespace:**
  - Add a space after keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`) and between operators (e.g., `x + y`).
  - Remove trailing whitespace.

## 5. Functions

- **Function Length:** Keep functions small and focused on a single task. If a function exceeds 20-30 lines, consider breaking it into smaller functions.
- **Parameter Limit:** Avoid functions with more than 3 parameters. If necessary, use an options object.

## 6. Error Handling

- **Exceptions:** Handle exceptions properly with `try/catch` blocks where appropriate.
- **Logging:** Use a consistent logging mechanism for errors (e.g., `console.error()`) and ensure error messages are clear.

## 7. Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for critical functions and components. Tests should cover edge cases and failure scenarios.
- **Test Naming:** Use descriptive names for test cases that explain what the test is doing (e.g., `should_return_false_for_invalid_email()`).

## 8. Security

- **Input Validation:** Validate all user input, especially for web forms and API requests.
- **Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Dependencies:** Keep third-party libraries up to date and audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Git Workflow

- **Branching:** Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`) for new features. Use descriptive names for branch names.
- **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests for review. Ensure that pull requests include a clear description of changes.
- **Merging:** Only merge branches into `main` or `master` after code review and passing tests.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase. Happy coding!
